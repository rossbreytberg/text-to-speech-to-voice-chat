# Text-to-Speech-to-Voice-Chat

## What is this?
This batch script links together a few programs to allow you to generate speech by typing which can be played into an input for voice chatting software such as Discord or Skype.

This works on Windows only.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) for generating speech from text.
2. Install [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) media player to playback the speech generated by eSpeak.
3. Install the [VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device](http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/). The script will target VLC playback to this virtual audio device's input.
3a. *(Optional)* If you want to hear your own generated voice, go to Control Panel -> Sound -> Recording Devices. Double-click on CABLE Output, go to the Listen tab, and check the box labeled "Listen to this device".
4. Set Discord, Skype, or any other voice chatting program to use VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device as its voice input. Remember to turn off push-to-talk and instead make the program transmit on voice activity.
5. Verify the included `speak.bat` file has the correct values for the `ESPEAK_PATH` and `VLC_PATH` variables.
6. Click on `speak.bat` to launch. Type messages and press enter. They should get played back to the voice chatting software.

## *(Optional, but Recommended)* Improved Voice
1. Follow the [Mbrola Voice](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/mbrola.html) instructions to allow eSpeak to use improved voices. (The `en1` voice sounds the most natural.)
2. Edit the included `speak.bat` file to change the `ESPEAK_VOICE` variable to be the name of the Mbrola voice, such as `mb-en`.

## Additional Voice Adjustments
Adjust the `ESPEAK_SPEED` and `ESPEAK_VOLUME` variables as necessary.
